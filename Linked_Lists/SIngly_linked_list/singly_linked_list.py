What are singly linked lists?
In this tutorial, we will learn about what singly linked
lists are and some very basic operations that can be performed on them.

Before we get into the details of what singly lists are,
we must learn what nodes are. This is because nodes are the building blocks of a linked list. A node consists of two parts:

Data part - contains the data
Address part - this is pointer that points to location of the next node
In a singly linked list, each nodeâ€™s address part contains the information about the location of the next node.
This forms a series of chain or links. The first node of the linked list is kept track by the head pointer. The last node points to None.

class Node(object):

    def __init__(self,value):
        self.value =  value
        self.nextNode = None



a = Node(1)
b = Node(2)
c = Node(3)

a.nextNode = b
b.nextNode = c
print(a.nextNode.value)
print(b.nextNode.value)
